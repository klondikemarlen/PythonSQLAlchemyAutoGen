# PythonSQLAlchemyAutoGen
Autogenerate SQLAlchemy Schema from non-declarative objects.

This will be done using Jinja2 templating and Python. Hopefully it will work :)
I have tried a couple attempts before with only partial success and hope to track my progress and learn more from my failures.

Requirements:
  Python v3+
  SQLAlchemy v??
  Jinj2 v2.9+
